# 🛑 Note on Chrome Web Store Availability

Currently, this extension is not available on the Chrome Web Store. Publishing extensions on the Web Store requires a one-time developer registration fee, and thus, I have chosen to make it available for manual installation. Follow the Installation in Chrome steps above to add it to your browser.
